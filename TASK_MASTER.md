# Project Task Master

This file tracks tasks and to-dos for the SEED-MCP project.

## Completed Tasks

- Set up Firebase MCP server configuration.
- Added endpoint to `seed-supabase.py` for selecting data from a Supabase table.
- Added insert, update, and delete endpoints to `seed-supabase.py`.
- Updated `main.py` to include new Supabase tools in server discovery.
- Updated `cline_mcp_settings.json` with the new Fly.io URL for the `seed-mcp` server.
- Attempted to update `cline_mcp_settings.json` with the provided IP address URL for the `seed-mcp` server.

## To-Do

- Document how to use the Supabase tools provided by `seed-mcp`.
- Explore other potential MCP server functionalities for the project.
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Ensure the `seed-mcp` server is running and accessible at its configured URL (`http://66.241.125.69:8080/`). The server still appears disconnected from the MCP system even after updating the URL and trying the IP address. **Please troubleshoot the server's connectivity and accessibility. I cannot proceed with verifying or documenting the tools until the server is connected.**
- Verify if the `seed-mcp` server now exposes the new tools correctly via MCP once it is connected.
