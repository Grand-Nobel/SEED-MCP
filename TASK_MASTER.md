# Project Task Master

This file tracks tasks and to-dos for the SEED-MCP project.

## Completed Tasks

- Set up Firebase MCP server configuration.
- Added endpoint to `seed-supabase.py` for selecting data from a Supabase table.
- Added insert, update, and delete endpoints to `seed-supabase.py`.
- Updated `main.py` to include new Supabase tools in server discovery.

## To-Do

- Document how to use the Supabase tools provided by `seed-mcp`.
- Explore other potential MCP server functionalities for the project.
- Ensure the `seed-mcp` server is running and accessible at its configured URL (`http://66.241.124.137:8080/`).
- Verify if the `seed-mcp` server now exposes the new tools correctly via MCP once it is connected.
